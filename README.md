# This a template to a full page with HTML and CSS
I made a complete page, functional with html, css and javascript
It can be used as a template.
This is the version **# 0.1** about my professional portfolio
## Things learned
I learn to how to edit css, and manipulate the DOM based on events, and select things in the DOM with the class.
The function .target was great to show where i do the clicks in the window
The function toggle edit the clases.

I am very excited to make my first portfolio of work, and this is the first steps.
